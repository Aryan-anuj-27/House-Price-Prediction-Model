# House-Price-Prediction-Model
This repository contains the code and data files for a house price prediction model using machine learning. The model utilizes the Ridge regression technique to predict house prices in Bengaluru, India.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is named Bengaluru_House_Data.csv. It includes information about various features of houses in Bengaluru, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, balconies, total area, location, and more. The dataset underwent cleaning and preprocessing to remove missing values and outliers. The cleaned data file is named cleaned_data.csv.

## Model

The machine learning model is implemented in a Jupyter notebook named `house_price.ipynb`. Three techniques were explored:

1. **No Regularization**: Accuracy score: 0.8234
2. **Lasso**: Accuracy score: 0.8128
3. **Ridge**: Accuracy score: 0.8234
